# Mini Projects README

## 1. Direct Marketing Campaign Analysis

### Introduction
This project explores direct marketing campaigns conducted by a banking institution using phone calls. The aim is to predict whether a client will subscribe ('yes') or not ('no') to the bank term deposit. Machine learning models are employed to identify target customers efficiently, thereby reducing time and cost.

### Files
- `Mini Project 1.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing detailed steps of preparing and comparing two suitable machine learning models.
- Dataset containing information about the direct marketing campaigns. 

## 2. Sentiment Analysis Using Sentiment140 Dataset

### Introduction
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using the Sentiment140 dataset, which comprises 1.6 million annotated tweets. The goal is to build and compare two machine learning models to classify the sentiment of tweets accurately.

### Files
- `Mini_Project_2`: Jupyter notebook containing the process of building and comparing two machine learning models for sentiment analysis.
- Dataset containing annotated tweets for sentiment analysis.

## 3. Human Activity Clustering Based on Sensor Data

### Introduction
This project explores human activity clustering based on sensor data collected from mobile phones. The dataset includes data from thirty volunteers performing six activities while wearing a smartphone with embedded sensors. Common machine learning models like K-Means and DBSCAN are utilized for clustering the sensor data.

### Files
